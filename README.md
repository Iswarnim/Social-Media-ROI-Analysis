# PepsiCo Social Media Analytics & Branding Project

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive analysis of PepsiCo's social media marketing performance, as part of the placement Guarantee Course Conducted by Internshala Training curriculum in Data Science. The goal was to act as a Data Analyst for PepsiCo, tasked with analyzing raw social media data to provide actionable insights for their marketing team.

The entire project—from data cleaning and analysis to the final dashboard—was completed using **Microsoft Excel**.

## Key Objectives

* To clean and preprocess raw data from multiple sources (Posts, Engagement, Campaigns).
* To analyze engagement metrics, content performance, and platform-specific trends.
* To measure the effectiveness and ROI of various marketing campaigns.
* To build an interactive, data-driven dashboard to present key findings.

## Dashboard & Key Findings

A final interactive dashboard was built within the Excel file to summarize the project's most important insights.

### Key Insights:
* **Platform Strategy:** A Tailored Approach Analysis revealed that no single platform wins in all categories. A sophisticated multi-platform strategy is recommended to optimize marketing spend:

Facebook: Recommended as the primary platform for Brand Awareness due to its unmatched volume and reach.

Instagram: The clear winner for Community Building, proving its superior average engagement rate builds a more loyal and responsive audience.

Twitter: The main engine for Audience Growth, demonstrating the highest effectiveness at attracting new followers.
* **Most Effective Content:** Platform-Specific Performance Content effectiveness varies significantly by platform. A one-size-fits-all approach is inefficient.

Instagram: Prioritize Reels (26% avg. engagement) and Stories (24.6%), which are the clear winners. Video (20.6%) and Text (12.9%) are also highly effective formats.

YouTube: A surprising insight showed that Carousels (17.4%) and Images (15%) delivered the highest engagement rates, outperforming other traditional video formats.

 
 **Campaign Effectiveness:** Return on Investment (ROI): The 'SummerSplash' and 'FestiveRadiance' campaigns delivered the highest ROI, proving the most financially efficient with a Cost Per Engagement (CPE) of just 1.45.
